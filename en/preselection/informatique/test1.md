# Test 1 – Creating a class for a robot

This test focuses on the design, implementation, and documentation of an object-oriented architecture around a main **Robot** class, which serves as the foundation for all robotic developments in the TEKBOT project.

## 1. Context {#context-competition}

Robotics today plays a central role in technological innovation, combining computer science, electronics, and mechanics to design intelligent systems capable of interacting with their environment. This project is part of the Tekbot Robotics Challenge 2025 and constitutes the introductory challenge for the computer science part of the competition.

It involves designing and implementing an object-oriented architecture around a main **Robot** class, which will serve as the basis for all future robotic developments. The approach aims to introduce students to software modeling, code structuring, and thinking about software architecture in a robotic context.

The emphasis is on understanding the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming and their concrete application in a technical project.

## 2. Objectives {#objectives}

The objectives are:

- Design a **Robot** class respecting the principles of object-oriented programming: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- Implement at least two specialized subclasses derived from the Robot class
- Redefine the `move()` method in the subclasses to illustrate polymorphism
- Ensure correct encapsulation of attributes (private attributes, getters/setters)
- Provide clear and compliant UML documentation

## 3. Project Structure {#project-structure}

The TEKBOT project is organized according to a modular architecture faithful to the actual folder tree:

## 4. Object-Oriented Programming - Complete Implementation {#oop-principles}

The TEKBOT project illustrates the major principles of OOP through a modular and realistic architecture. Here is a pedagogical explanation of each concept, accompanied by concrete examples from the project's code.

### 4.0 THE CONSTRUCTOR – Object Initialization

**Detailed Definition:** The constructor is a special method of a class (in Python, `__init__`) that is called automatically when creating a new object. It allows initializing the object's attributes with starting values, ensuring that each instance starts in a coherent state.

**Example in the project:**

```python
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, nom: str, energie: float = 100.0):
        self._nom = nom
        self._energie = energie
        self._etat = "prêt"
```

The `__init__` constructor initializes the robot's name, energy, and state upon creation.

### 4.1 ENCAPSULATION – Protection and Control

**Detailed Definition:** Encapsulation is the principle of grouping data (attributes) and methods that manipulate this data within the same entity (the class). It protects the object's internal state by making certain attributes private (prefix `_` or `__`), accessible only through public methods called accessors (getters) and mutators (setters). This allows controlling data modification and avoiding inconsistencies.

**Example in the project:**

```python
class Capteur(ABC):
    def __init__(self, id_capteur: str, type_capteur: str):
        self._id = id_capteur.strip()      # Private attribute
        self._type = type_capteur.strip()  # Private attribute
        self._valeur = 0.0                 # Private attribute

    def get_valeur(self) -> float:
        return self._valeur

    def set_valeur(self, v: float):
        if v >= 0:
            self._valeur = v
        else:
            raise ValueError("Valeur invalide")
```

Here, the attributes are protected and access is done through dedicated methods, ensuring the consistency of values.

### 4.2 INHERITANCE – Reuse and Specialization

**Detailed Definition:** Inheritance allows creating a new class (called "child" or "derived") from an existing class (called "parent" or "base"). The child class inherits the attributes and methods of the parent class, which promotes code reuse and specialization. It can also redefine or extend certain behaviors.

**Example in the project:**

```python
class Robot(ABC):
    # Abstract base class

class RobotMobile(Robot):
    def __init__(self, nom: str, vitesse: float):
        super().__init__(nom)  # Call parent constructor
        self._vitesse_max = float(vitesse)
```

The `RobotMobile` class inherits from `Robot` and adds specific functionalities related to mobility.

### 4.3 POLYMORPHISM – Flexibility and Extensibility

**Detailed Definition:** Polymorphism allows using the same interface (method or attribute) for objects of different types. Each subclass can redefine the inherited method to adapt its behavior. Thus, the same method call can produce different effects depending on the targeted object.

**Example in the project:**

```python
class Capteur(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def lire_valeur(self):
        pass

class Camera(Capteur):
    def lire_valeur(self):
        # Specific to the camera
        pass

class Gyroscope(Capteur):
    def lire_valeur(self):
        # Specific to the gyroscope
        pass

# Polymorphic usage
capteurs = [Camera(...), Gyroscope(...)]
for capteur in capteurs:
    capteur.lire_valeur()  # Calls the method adapted to each type
```

The same method (`lire_valeur`) is called on each object, but the behavior depends on the concrete subclass.

### 4.4 ABSTRACTION – Simplification and Modularity

**Detailed Definition:** Abstraction consists of defining classes or methods without concrete implementation (abstract classes or methods). It imposes a contract on subclasses, which must provide their own implementation. This allows structuring the code and clarifying the responsibilities of each class.

**Example in the project:**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Robot(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def move(self):
        pass  # Must be redefined in subclasses
```

The `Robot` class imposes the presence of the `move()` method in its subclasses, without giving the details.

### 4.5 COMPOSITION & AGGREGATION – Building Complex Objects

**Detailed Definition:** Composition and aggregation are relationships that allow building complex objects from other objects. Composition implies that the composed object owns and manages the lifecycle of its components; aggregation indicates a more flexible relationship, where objects can exist independently.

**Example in the project:**

```python
class ActionSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self._actionneurs: Dict[str, Actionneur] = {}
        self._moteurs: List[Moteur] = []
        self._bras_robotiques: List[BrasRobotique] = []
```

The `ActionSystem` class is composed of `Moteur`, `BrasRobotique`, and `Actionneur` objects: it orchestrates their operation.
