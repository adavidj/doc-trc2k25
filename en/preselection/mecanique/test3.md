# Test 3 Mechanical: SolidWorks CAD – Advanced Level

Expert parametric modeling and complex mechanical design under SolidWorks as part of the **Tekbot Robotics Challenge 2025**.

---

## 🔹 Introduction

This test aims to evaluate our ability to design a complex mechanical part in 3D using SolidWorks. It focuses on modeling, constraint and dimension management, as well as obtaining a coherent part both mechanically and functionally.

The main objective is to model a part from variable dimensions, ensuring a precise final mass thanks to the correct definition of the material and its density. The results obtained must reflect a thorough mastery of modeling tools as well as good analysis capabilities.
